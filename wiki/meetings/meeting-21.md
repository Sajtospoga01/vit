- Andras Bodrogai

Discussion: 
- Adapted MetaArcSSL(DINOv2) trainer to work with the new HSI model
    - Random masking on both the spatial spectral data
    - Loss calculation is performed on both outputs
- Running training on the model (close to finishing â€“ takes a lot of time)

Blocker:
- Model was training for 4 days in straight blocking other development progress
